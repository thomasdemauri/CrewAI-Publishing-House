    Take the final book content and transform it into a well-structured DOCX file formatted
    in a professional book style, using you DOCX writer tool. The text must be organized like a real published book,
    following a consistent and standardized structure (chapters, sections, headings, spacing,
    and transitions), not like a simple literal text dump.
    
    Ensure the formatting resembles a real book manuscript, with proper chapter titles,
    section hierarchy, and a clean narrative flow. The final result must feel like a polished
    book ready for publishing.

    Do not write something new, just copy and make little fixes on it
